          In your starter guide you say to use whole grain rye flour, can I use
          something else
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          I call for whole-grain rye flour when creating a starter because the
          additional nutrients in rye flour help speed up the process. You can
          certainly use whole wheat flour or even white (sifted) flour if you'd
          like, but I find rye flour to be the most effective flour at the
          beginning. If you don't have rye flour, then whole wheat works!

          My starter died! It had lots of activity early on, but now it seems
          dead, what happened?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          It's normal to see a lapse of activity at some point when first
          creating a sourdough starter—this is normal. The initial proliferation
          of action at the beginning of creating a starter is from a different
          type of bacteria in your mixture that will eventually be replaced by
          the kind we are looking for (lactic acid bacteria). Keep feeding, and
          discarding, as I outline in my creation guide. Eventually, your
          mixture will slowly become more and more acidic (low pH), killing off
          other bacteria and allow the beneficial yeast and bacteria we are
          looking for to take hold.

          I've been following your starter creation guide, but nothing is
          happening, what's wrong?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The number one problem I see people face is low temperature: it's
          easier to create your starter if you keep it at a warmer temperature.
          Cold temperatures (below 70°F/21°C) will slow the process down
          significantly, whereas warmer temperatures (around 76-82°F/24-26°C)
          will speed it up. Try to find a warm spot in your kitchen to keep your
          starter or use more lukewarm water for feeding. For more information
          on starter and dough temperatures, see my post on the importance of
          dough temperature.
